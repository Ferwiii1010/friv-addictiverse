Thank you for visiting the legendary classic old Friv! Friv started way back in 2006 and grew really popular as a place to play. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
Families could be sure that the games were fun and that the site was safe. Millions of kids all over the world would visit Friv at 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
home or at school and play the latest Flash games.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
Then, at the end of 2020, Adobe Flash was discontinued and all those amazing games and even this iconic menu system stopped 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
working. Friv had a new site up and running by then, but we were so incredibly sad that all those classic games would not work 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
any more, and were now just fading memories.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
But there are happy times ahead... Emulation is now finally good enough for us to make some of those amazing old Flash games 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
available again. Not all the games will work just yet, and some may play a little slowly or with a few bugs. Nevertheless, we know 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
how important the memories are, so please go ahead and relive your childhood!
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
Do remember that this site really is for the memories. For the best playing experience on all devices, you should visit the new 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
and up to date friv.com ...happy gaming!
