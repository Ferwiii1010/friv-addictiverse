The privacy and safety of our users is very important to us. Friv has become popular around the world 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
with users of all ages, and we’re always working hard to make Friv a safe place to play for everyone. We 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
rarely communicate directly with our users, and we never allow users to communicate with each other 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
via chat or other services, or to enter personal information. This helps protect user privacy and safety.

Our website navigation system, the games, and adverts, will sometimes need to store a small amount of 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
data on your computer, or send and store data via servers elsewhere. This anonymised data helps 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
provide a better experience for our users – for example in saving level progress, and highlighting which 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
games are most popular, and which game levels users get stuck on. The data files we may store on your 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
computer are called ‘cookies’ and you can at any time set your browser to disallow or delete these as 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
you wish – just check your browser’s help section.
