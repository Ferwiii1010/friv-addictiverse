The privacy of users is extremely important to us. Below you will find information detailing the types of data received and collected by Friv and other parties, and how it is used.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
Log Files: As with all websites, Friv's servers record details of which files are accessed, along with data such as the time the request was made, and the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
user. Although each computer may have a unique IP address, this identifier is never linked to any personal information such as the name or street address of the user. Log files have been used 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
universally since the dawn of the internet and are invaluable in identifying errors with web pages and, in the case of Friv, with the games. Our servers are set to keep daily log files for a 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
maximum of one month, after which they are permanently deleted.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
Cookies / Flash Shared Objects: To help provide an enhanced user experience, most modern browsers allow websites to store small amounts of data on users' computers. This information is 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
stored in the form of small text files called 'cookies' or, in the case of the interactive content on Friv, in 'Flash Shared Objects'. Examples of the information stored might include the number 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
of games a user has played, the country the user is in (as taken from the user's IP address), and the level progress made on a game. No data stored is personally identifiable. You can at any 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
time delete the cookies and Flash Shared Objects your computer holds - just check your browser's privacy settings. You can manage your computer's use of Flash Shared Objects by right-
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
clicking anywhere on this page and selecting Global Settings.

Tracking: Sometimes our menu system and the games on Friv may send information to third-party tracking services. The information collected (while never personally identifiable) is useful, 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
for example, in providing general insights into visitor numbers and which games are most popular.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
Advertising Networks: Keeping a popular website up and running can be expensive, and so sometimes we show advertisements which help generate income. The ads are typically served by 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
third party ad networks, and although we try hard to ensure that the companies advertising are reliable and honest, the reality of the internet means that our influence over the every-
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
changing offerings of these networks is limited. Ad networks will typically show ads based on the kind of users they expect to be playing on Friv, and as described above, may store small 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
amounts of data on a user's computer. This information, which is never personally identifiable, may help advertisers target an individual user based on their visit to Friv and other sites and 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
pages they have viewed in the past. This kind of advertising, which has become increasingly popular, is called retargeting. Users are now given greater control than ever over how ad networks 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
use this data. You can opt out of the cookie / retargeting functions of many of these networks by clicking
